\chapter{Relevance of ATF/ATF2}
\section{Facility purpose}
The main objective of the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) built at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Tsukuba, Japan, is to serve as R\&D platform for the requirements of linear accelerators, in particular ILC. ATF obtained the record of minimum vertical beam emittance \cite{Kubo:2001ps,PhysRevLett.92.054802}, leading to the next step, the vertical beam size reduction at the IP.\par
The Final Focus Test Beam (FFTB) \cite{Berndt:1991ug}, at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in the  U.S.A., explored the beam size reduction using the non-local chromaticity correction scheme. It operated since 1994 to 1997 with a final result of 70nm in the vertical plane. The designed 40nm was not achieved and the difference was attributed to beam jitter and tuning limitations \cite{Araki1}.\par
The beam size reduction using the local chromaticity correction is explored by an extension of the original design, called ATF2 \cite{ATF2prop,grishanov:in2p3-00309474}, then ILC-like FFS lattice scaled down to 100m with two goals: ({\textbf{goal 1}) achieve 37nm of vertical beamsize at the IP and ({\textbf{goal 2}) the stabilization of the IP beam position at the level of few nanometres.\par
The CLIC, ILC and ATF2 main parameters are shown in Table \ref{t:ILC_ATF2param}, where the vertical cromaticity $\xi_y$ is similar for ATF and ILC designs.\par

\section{Beam line Description}
The ATF accelerator facility, shown in Fig. \ref{f:ATF}, is composed by a photocathode giving electrons to a linac which accelerates the particles to 1.3 GeV, a damping ring to reduce the beam vertical and horizontal emittance and an extraction line which provides bunch packets to the Final Focus (FF) Section  where the beam is transported to the nominal IP and dump.\par

\end{figure}
The ATF2 lattice could be subdivided in two sections : the matching section and the FFS. In the FFS, quadrupoles are placed on individual movers to allow the beam steering and adjustment of relative alignment in X, Y and Roll angle. The top of Fig. \ref{f:FF_MADX} shows the lattice elements where the last point on the right corresponds to the nominal IP followed upstream by the QD0FF and QF1FF magnets, vertically and horizontally focusing, respectively. This pair is called the Final Doublet (FD).\par

\end{figure}
Below the lattice, Fig. \ref{f:FF_MADX} shows the vertical and horizontal $\beta$ functions reduction at QF7FF and the IP. This reduces the transfer matrix between these two points to the equivalent of a telescope with fixed magnification factor. The horizontal off-momentum function $\eta$ cancels at the IP, peaks in the FD region to correct chromaticity while it is reduced upstream in the sextupoles region. Additional chromaticity is created before QF7FF following the local-chromaticity correction method.

\section{Recent achievements and current work}
In 2014 vertical beam size about 55nm was observed at ATF2 \cite{Kubo50nm}, and since then smaller beam size can be achieved systematically down to 44nm \cite{KuboCLICws2015} demonstrating the local chromaticity correction method at charges below $0.1\times10^{10}$ particules per bunch.\par
The identified issue of intensity dependence is currently explored by the ATF2 collaboration. However, at low intensities the beam size remains above the designed 37nm. Possible contributions are: (1) the increase of the incoming beam emittance through out the ATF2 line, (2) systematic errors and resolution limitations on the beam size monitor, (3) beam drift beyond the tolerable margin and  (4) undetected optics mismatch.\par
Last two issues can be adressed by measuring the beam trajectory in the IP Region after the Final Doublet. In adittion, looking forward to \textbf{goal 2}, beam position measurement is a requirement for beam stabilization.\par
The work here described corresponds to the beam position monitors installed in 2013 by LAL in collaboration with Kyungpook National University (KNU), the Feedback in Nanosecond Timescale (FONT) group from Oxford, and the ATF2 staff.\par
