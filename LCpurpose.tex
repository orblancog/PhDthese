\chapter{Purpose of a linear collider}


In order to achieve higher luminosity, it is necessary to reduce the beam size to compensate the lower frequency collisions in linear accelerators compared with storage and collider rings \cite{Delahaye1999369}, and radiation effects should not be disregarded during the design stage of lattices.
